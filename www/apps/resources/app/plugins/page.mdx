A plugin is a package of re-usable Medusa customizations, including [modules](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules), [workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows), [API routes](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/api-routes), and more.

Plugins are useful if you want to re-use your customizations across Medusa applications, or you want to share those customizations with the community. You publish your plugin to NPM, then install it in a Medusa application to use its features.

<Note>

Learn more about plugins and their difference from modules in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/plugins).
